# Regression Analysis for Portughese Red Wine - Python

The scope of this analysis is to predict the quality of Portughese 'Vino Verde' red wine samples based on a number of key properties. Red wine quality is assessed by multiple physicochemical properties ranging from alcohol levels to various acidity levels, which when combined give the wine its unique taste and aroma.

### Objectives
-   Perform an exploratory data analysis on the dataset
-  Implement Chi-Square and Correlation Coefficient in order to reduce the number of features being tested
-  Analyse different regression models, including: Linear Regression, Regularised Regression, kNN regression, Radial basis functions and Polynomial basis functions

### Dataset

 #### About this project
